# **Groupie Trackers**

**Groupie Trackers** consists on receiving a given API and manipulate the data contained in it, in order to create a site, displaying the information.

It will be given an API, that consists in four parts:

### The first one:

artists, containing information about some bands and artists like their name(s), image, in which year they began their activity, the date of their first album and the members.

### The second one:

locations, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert locations.

### The third one:

dates, consists in their last and/or upcoming concert dates.

### And the last one:

relation, does the link between all the other parts, artists, dates and locations.

Given all this you should build a user friendly website where you can display the bands info through several data visualizations (examples : blocks, cards, tables, list, pages, graphics, etc). It is up to you to decide how you will display it.

This project also focuses on the creation of events/actions and on their visualization.

The event/action we want you to do is known as a client call to the server (client-server). We can say it is a feature of your choice that needs to trigger an action. This action must communicate with the server in order to recieve information, (\[request-response\])(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request%E2%80%93response)

An event consists in a system that responds to some kind of action triggered by the client, time, or any other factor.

#### Instructions

> The backend must be written in Go.  
> The site and server cannot crash at any time.  
> All pages must work correctly and you must take care of any errors.  
> The code must respect the good practices.  
> It is recommended to have test files for unit testing.  
> Allowed packages  
> Only the standard Go packages are allowed.

#### Usage

You can see an example of a RESTful API here  
This project will help you learn about :

Manipulation and storage of data.  
JSON files and format.  
HTML.  
Event creation and display.  
Client-server.
